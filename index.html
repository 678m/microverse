        <p> A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related </br>
          a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should</br>
           be organized into paragraphs. </p>
       <p> This is because paragraphs show a reader 
         where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization </br>
         of the essay and grasp its main points.</p>
